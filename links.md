Here you can find my collection of links that I found while studying Operating Systems. Some of it was connected to the course, while others were just for fun. Please take a look!

## Study Related / OS Links
* [os.vlsm.org](https://os.vlsm.org/)
    I think if you are visiting this page, you will actually know how useful this link is.
* [Online Markdown Editor](https://dillinger.io/)
    I actually use this website to write this and all the other markdown files on this repo. Thank you dillinger.io, very cool!
* [Regex Debugger / Visualizer](https://www.debuggex.com/)
    It is self-explanatory. I found this from the videos in the week 01 slide. I used this one to learn and practice regular expression. 
* [Neso OS Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRiVhbXDGLXDk_OQAeuVcp2O)
   [Neso C Programming](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRggZZgYpPMUxdY1CYkZtARR)


## Fun stuff / Other Links
* [Kitten Rice Bath](https://youtu.be/Q9iWKabmkr4)
    The dislike is from those who thought it was about cooking kitten. I watched this one in the middle of GSGS, the thumbnail is something else.
* [How to exit vim](https://youtu.be/w00JOVpapxA)
    So, this is what it felt like being mocked by a meme.
    I was actually stuck on vim at one point and unable to exit it. This was youtube's top recommendation for me. Very cool algoritm from Google.
