* [Online Markdown Editor](https://dillinger.io/)
    I actually use this website to write this and all the other markdown files on this repo. Thank you dillinger.io, very cool!

* [Bug Bounty Resources](https://github.com/daffainfo/AllAboutBugBounty)

* [C Pointer lecture UNSW](https://youtu.be/Rxvv9krECNw)
  The title itself is self-explanatory. Pointers can be hard to understand sometimes, but this lecture helps me grasp the concept quite well.

* [Neso's C pointer lecture playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBlnK6fEyqRjoG6aJ4FvFU1tlXbjLBiOP)
  The other link is for C programming in general, but this one focuses on the pointer.
* [Bug Bounty Roadmap](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1610889439172/wAmw3SEGa.jpeg?auto=compress)
  We might want to do some cybersec action but don't know where to start. This roadmap will at least give you a little bit of insight into it.

## Fun stuff / Other Links
* [Kitten Rice Bath](https://youtu.be/Q9iWKabmkr4)
    The dislike is from those who thought it was about cooking kitten. I watched this one in the middle of GSGS, the thumbnail is something else.
* [How to exit vim](https://youtu.be/w00JOVpapxA)
    So, this is what it felt like being mocked by a meme.
    I was actually stuck on vim at one point and unable to exit it. This was youtube's top recommendation for me. Very cool algoritm from Google.
